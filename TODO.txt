NEW AWS ENDPOINTS FOR TESTING
-----------------------------
1. Use jose in line with websample1.NEW and reduce libraries from current size of 2MB / 623KB
   Check that performance logging works as expected and shows OAuth details

SECURE COOKIE SIGN OFF
----------------------
1. Test my local setup against all 4 desktop browsers
   Deploy SPA to /spa2 and test
   Performance will be slow due to work on every API call

CACHE
-----
1. Get a local Docker Redis setup and get / set data.
   Write code to interact with Redis as a strategy.

2. Run low cost Redis in AWS for /api2
   Monitor closely to ensure costs are as expected

REFINEMENTS
-----------
1. Merge plumbing-base and plumbing-oauth and compare to NodeJS API

2. Automate flows to get SPA cookies and mobile tokens to improve productivity

BLOG NOTES
----------
Lambda authorizer has only basic capabilities:
- Cache using policy document based on Authorization header, but no support for cookies
- Also CORS error responses cannot be dynamically controlled

So it is better to use a more portable option, since the API will need persistence anyway.
