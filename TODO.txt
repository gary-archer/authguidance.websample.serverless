CONSOLIDATION
-------------
1. Get rid of url - see websample1.NEW

2. Lib size is 2.6MB and mostly all jose
   Can I do some custom packaging to reduce its size?

3. Merge plumbing-base and plumbing-oauth and compare to NodeJS API

CACHE
-----
1. Use a local Docker Redis setup: get / set data + basically secured.
   Write code to interact with Redis as a strategy.

2. Run low cost Redis in AWS for /api2
   Monitor closely to ensure costs are as expected
